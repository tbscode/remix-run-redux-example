### Remix.run + redux

Simple example for how one can use remix.run + redux.
Since I was wondering how to do this - so tried - and saw this stack overflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70780146/how-to-provide-a-redux-store-to-remix-js-project

Not the only nor prob the best way to integrate redux into remix, 
but one way, please open an issue if of comment on the overflow question if you have change suggestions.
